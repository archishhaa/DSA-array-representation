# Data Structures and Algorithms: Array Representation

## Overview

This README provides an overview of array representation in data structures and algorithms. Arrays are fundamental data structures used to store collections of elements in contiguous memory locations.

## One-Dimensional Arrays

In one-dimensional arrays, elements are stored in a linear sequence. Each element occupies a contiguous memory location and can be accessed using an index.

Example:
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

## Multi-Dimensional Arrays

Multi-dimensional arrays are arrays of arrays. They can be represented as arrays of rows or arrays of columns.

Example:
[
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9]
]

## Operations on Arrays

Arrays support various operations such as:

- **Access**: Accessing elements by index.
- **Insertion**: Adding elements at the beginning, end, or any given position.
- **Deletion**: Removing elements from the array.
- **Search**: Searching for an element in the array.
- **Traversal**: Iterating through all elements of the array.

## Advantages of Arrays

- **Random Access**: Elements can be accessed directly using an index.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, making memory access efficient.
- **Simple and Fast**: Array operations are generally simple and fast, with constant-time access for single-dimensional arrays.

## Limitations of Arrays

- **Fixed Size**: Arrays have a fixed size, which must be specified at the time of declaration.
- **Costly Insertions and Deletions**: Insertions and deletions in the middle of an array are costly as it requires shifting elements.
- **Contiguous Memory Requirement**: Arrays require contiguous memory allocation, which may not always be available.

## Conclusion

Arrays are versatile data structures that provide efficient storage and access to elements. Understanding their representation and operations is crucial for designing and implementing algorithms efficiently.
